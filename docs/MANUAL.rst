    After starting the console user interface you are in the main screen.
    Here you just can login or shutdown/reboot the system or, (most important)
    you can switch between light and dark mode.

        :alt: Main Screen dark
        :align: left

    Because light mode is hurting some people's eyes a bit, you can hit <F1>
    to switch between dark and light mode.

    At first the only senseful option is to use <F2> to log in.
    You should use a superuser account if you want to change system configuration.

    After successful login you are in the main menu where you can change a few
    system settings.

    The menu contains the ability to change password, manage network or use a
    plain text terminal, who knows what will come up?

    In the first menu you can change your password. At the moment it is
    just a simple subshell with passwd called.

    where you can configure your active device, set up your IP Address
    and DNS configuration.

    the device you want to set up.

    The last point to configure here is the "DNS Configuration" menu for configuring
    domain name specific settings.

    Back in the main menu the last point is to use the plain text terminal to do
    any task that cannot be done in this console user interface.

------------------------

    The terminal can be used as a little temporary modal dialog from where you can
    switch back to cui menues immediately.

    terminal again with the default shell.
